Hey! 
I’m [Alicia](https://aliciachr.carrd.co/), an amateur software engineer based in Seattle.

Many of my tech-related projects are guides and books, since I'm also passionate about graphic design. But, I do have a few coding WIPS, mostly games.

My current project is an RPG game called Sleep Tight, Sweet Dreams.

If you would like to stay up to date on my projects, consider subscribing to my [Substack](https://byt3siz3d.substack.com/).

When I’m not working on tech stuff, I’m probably messing with graphics, brainstorming content ideas, or being supervised by my cat, Normandy, who thinks he’s the lead dev.
